# Demo missions

The best way to get comfortable with a Moose class is to try the demo missions
of the class you want to learn. The Moose team created a lot of demo missions
for most of the classes.

## Download demo missions

Go to the repository [MOOSE_MISSIONS]{:target="_blank"}, search the folder of
the class, download the mission (`.miz`) and run them.

## Read the mission script

In the same folder a `.lua` file with the same name is placed which is the
included mission script. You can watch these mission scripts easily online at
GitHub to understand what is happening in the mission.

## Read documentation

Next step is to read the [documentation]{:target="_blank"} of the class to
understand the code of the demo mission.

{: .note }
> The documentation is quite long and might be confusing for beginners.
> Start by looking at the description at the top of the documentation of a
> class. It often contains examples and explanations. <br /><br />
> Then search for the function names and look at the description of the
> functions and its parameters.

## Make small changes to the script

Download the `.lua` file, change the parameters to suit your needs in
[Notepad++]{:target="_blank"}, add it to the mission and rerun the mission.
Observe what happens and adapt the code.

If you want to use more functions combine them all up.

{: .note }
> But it is wise to do this in small steps. So it is easier to find errors.

## Next step

If the mission does not show the expected behaviour take a look at section
[problems].
